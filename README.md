# The Password Generator!

For better online security, you need a strong unique password for each and every website you sign up for.
This application generates strong passwords with letters, symbols, and numbers.
The application asks the user the number of letters, symbols and numbers they would like in their password.
After providing these numbers, the app generates a strong password.

The code for this password generator can be found at my [Password Generator Github Repository](https://github.com/isaac-awotwe/password-generator).
